Inria
ReservoirChat uses up-to-date documentation and code examples from ReservoirPy: a Python library to code reservoir computing based neural networks (More info). ReservoirChat is a beta tool provided by Mnemosyne lab at Inria, Bordeaux, France. It is supported by Inria (BrainGPT project) and ANR (DeepPool project).

ReservoirChat
Hi and welcome! My name is ReservoirChat. I'm a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) interface specialized in Reservoir Computing using a Large Language Model (LLM) to help respond to your questions. Based on several documents and ReservoirPy documentation, I can answer general questions on Reservoir Computing and generate code. I am based on GraphRag and Codestral.

Work In Progress
ReservoirChat is currently being fine-tuned with additional data, so the service may be unusually slow. Please come back later if it's too slow.

Simple and flexible code for Reservoir Computing architectures like Echo State Networks (ESN).

🎉 Exciting News! We just launched a new beta tool based on a Large Language Model! 🚀 You can chat with our "ReservoirChat" and ask anything about Reservoir Computing or coding reservoirs! 🤖💡 Don’t miss out, it’s available for a limited time! ⏳ https://chat.reservoirpy.inria.fr

from reservoirpy.nodes import Reservoir, Ridge, Input

data = Input(input_dim=1)
reservoir = Reservoir(100, lr=0.3, sr=1.1)
readout = Ridge(ridge=1e-6)

esn = data >> reservoir >> readout

forecast = esn.fit(X, y).run(timeseries)
ReservoirPy is a simple user-friendly library based on Python scientific modules. It provides a flexible interface to implement efficient Reservoir Computing (RC) architectures with a particular focus on Echo State Networks (ESN). Advanced features of ReservoirPy allow to improve computation time efficiency on a simple laptop compared to basic Python implementation, with datasets of any size.

Some of its features are: offline and online training, parallel implementation, sparse matrix computation, fast spectral initialization, advanced learning rules (e.g. Intrinsic Plasticity) etc. It also makes possible to easily create complex architectures with multiple reservoirs (e.g. deep reservoirs), readouts, and complex feedback loops. Moreover, graphical tools are included to easily explore hyperparameters with the help of the hyperopt library. Finally, it includes several tutorials exploring exotic architectures and examples of scientific papers reproduction.

For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist. Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags.
